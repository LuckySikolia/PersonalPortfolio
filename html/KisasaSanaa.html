                <h5>Problem</h5>
                <p>Artists in Kenya grapple with a <mark class="scroll-highlight"> of exhibition spaces, especially outside major cities.</mark> 
                    This shortage restricts their visibility, market reach, and growth opportunities. 
                    The importance for accessible spaces is vital to showcase their work and cultivate a flourishing artistic community.</p>

                <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
                <hr>
            </div>

            <div class="prj-research-body">
                <h5>User-Centric Research</h5>
                <p>My design process began with a commitment to understanding user needs and market dynamics. I embarked on a comprehensive user research initiative to 
                    gain a deep understanding of user behavior and current attitudes towards art visibility. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="last-paragraph">This research took a multi-pronged approach:
                    <span class="paragraph-lists">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>In-depth Interviews</strong><br> I conducted in-depth interviews with a diverse range of stakeholders within the art market. This 
                                included art collectors, established and emerging artists, and art gallery representatives. Through these interviews, I was able to 
                                delve into their motivations, frustrations, and desired experiences related to discovering and acquiring art.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>User Surveys</strong><br> To reach a broader audience and gather quantitative data, I designed and deployed user surveys. The 
                                surveys captured demographics, art purchasing habits, and preferences regarding online art platforms.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </span>
                </p>
                    
                
                <br>
                <h5>Debunking Initial Assumption</h5>
                <p>The user research proved instrumental in shaping the project's direction. My initial assumption of an oversaturated art market was challenged by the data. 
                    Instead, the research revealed a more nuanced picture. While the art market is indeed dynamic, a key finding emerged –  emerging artists face significant 
                    hurdles in attaining visibility for their work due to the absence of established platforms tailored to their needs. 
                </p>
               
                <blockquote><u>Initial assumption</u> 
                    <br>
                    The art market is oversaturated making it difficult for newer artists to gain recognition
                    <!-- <ol>
                        <li></li>                        
                    </ol>                       -->
                </blockquote>

                <p>This critical insight became the cornerstone of the project, informing subsequent ideation phases. By<mark class="scroll-highlight"> focusing on the needs of emerging artists</mark> , the project 
                    aimed to develop a solution that<mark class="scroll-highlight"> bridged the gap in art visibility and empowered a new generation of creators.</mark> 
                </p>

                <br>
                <h5>User Pain Points</h5>
                <p>The following user painpoints assertained the need to focus on women in the community as the target audience.
                    <span class="paragraph-lists">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Limited online discoverability for artists</strong> Disorganized nature of information found online, particularly on social media platforms, makes it difficult for users to find art by Kenyan artists.</li>
                            <li><strong>inclusivity challenges for emerging artists</strong>Newer artists encounter challenges in having their work featured in art galleries, as some galleries prefer collaboration with established artists, thereby hindering the inclusivity of emerging talents.</li>                            
                            <li><strong>Limited access to art exhibits</strong> There are fewer art exhibitions happening outside major cities, restricts the physical platforms available for artists to showcase their work to potential clients. This scarcity also constrains the pool through which art collectors can access and discover artists and their creations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </span>
                </p>

                <br>
                <h5>How Might I Questions</h5>
                <p>Using data from the preliminary research I came up with how might we questions that would guide how I intepreted the research points and ideated a potential solution.
                    <span class="paragraph-lists">
                        <ul>
                            <li><mark class="scroll-highlight">How might I improve online discoverability of Kenyan artists </mark> by streamlining information and creating dedicated showcases within existing art platforms?</li>
                            <li><mark class="scroll-highlight">How might I facilitate broader exposure for emerging artists </mark> by establishing alternative exhibition channels beyond traditional galleries, both online and offline?</li>
                            <li><mark class="scroll-highlight">How might I ensure a more equitable distribution of art exposure </mark>by creating a platform that promotes and connects artists from diverse geographical locations with potential patrons?</strong> </li>
                        </ul>
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>With a clearer view on the research findings I created a clear problem statement to guide the rest of the design process.
                    <blockquote>
                     <u>Problem Statement</u> 
                     <br> The art market is characterized by a disconnect between enthusiasts and artists, with enthusiasts encountering 
                     challenges in discovering desired pieces, established artists facing limited online visibility, and emerging artists lacking exhibition opportunities
                    </blockquote>
                </p>

                <h5>User Persona</h5>
                <p>To better guide the design and enable me to empathize with our users, I further synthesized the preliminary research results and came up with the following persona</p>
                <figure class="prj-illustration">
                    <img src="/assets/kisasa_assets/user_persona.png" alt="">
                </figure>
                

                <h5>User Journey Map</h5>
                <p>I used a user journey map to <mark class="scroll-highlight">visually depict the actions, emotions, and thought processes of the target users, </mark> an art collector, as they navigate the process of acquiring art. 
                    This approach helps identify pain points and opportunities to create a delightful user experience.

                <p>Right from the start, <mark class="scroll-highlight">accessibility was a major priority for this solution.</mark> To make sure it reached the widest audience possible, I opted for a responsive web application. 
                    This decision followed a comprehensive analysis of existing art platforms and leading e-commerce solutions, like Kilimall.
                </p>
                <p>A responsive web application offers a seamless user experience across different devices, from desktops and laptops to tablets and smartphones. This eliminates the need for platform-specific 
                    downloads, making the platform truly accessible to a wider audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially,<mark class="scroll-highlight"> I considered the idea of including an events section. However, after taking a closer look at the landscape, I realized existing social media platforms like Nairobi Now and Hustle 
                    Sasa were already doing a fantastic job of event discovery. By focusing solely on art sales and promotion, this platform can offer a more laser-focused solution to the user's core problem.</mark>

                    <blockquote>

                <p>Informed by user research, the sitemap prioritizes the core shopping experience by meticulously structuring the information hierarchy on the platform.

                <h5>Ideate with crazy 8s</h5>
                <p>In the initial wireframing stage, I leveraged the Crazy 8s technique to rapidly generate a variety of design ideas. This focus on rapid iteration allowed me to 
                    explore numerous possibilities while keeping the core user experience
                </p>
                <p> I then translated these initial ideas into low-fidelity wireframes, prioritizing essential features identified in the research phase.  Here, I opted for a pen-and-paper 
                    approach to focus on core functionality and user flow before adding visual complexity.
                    <br>
                    <!-- With responsiveness in mind, I created the digital wireframes considering layouts for various screen sizes. -->

                <h5> Refining the Design, Usability Testing Insights </h5>
                <p>To evaluate the user experience and ensure the platform effectively meets user needs, I conducted a remote moderated usability study using low-fidelity mockups with a group of 5 participants.</p>
                <p>The valuable feedback received led to the following key findings

                            <li><strong><i>Simplified Cart Access:</i></strong> Participants expressed a desire for <mark class="scroll-highlight">a more streamlined approach to accessing their shopping cart.  In response, the design will 
                                integrate a shopping cart icon </mark>located near the user profile, eliminating the need to navigate through settings for quicker cart access.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong><i>Checkout Progress Visualization:</i></strong> The study revealed that <mark class="scroll-highlight"> a visual progress bar at the top of the checkout process would be beneficial </mark>.  This 
                                progress bar will provide users with a clear understanding of their checkout journey, enhancing its overall usability.
                            </li>

                    </span>
                </p>

                <h5>Design Changes</h5>
                <p>In response to insights gained from the usability study, I enhanced the site's browsing page. Notably, I introduced a shape change to distinguish between artwork and artist profiles. This 
                    modification is intended to elevate the overall user experience by enhancing visual clarity and differentiation.

                </p>
                <p>The checkout process was further enhanced by integrating a visual progress bar at the top.  This user-friendly feature provides clear guidance throughout the checkout journey, keeping users
                    informed of their progress and reducing potential confusion.

                <h5>Unveiling the Vision: High-Fidelity Mockups</h5>
                <p>Building on user research and testing, i came up with these high-fidelity mockups for the mobile design. The refined visuals integrate valuable user feedback, enabling an 
                     evaluation of the user experience before development begins.</p>

                <h5>Designing for Everyone</h5>
                <p>Accessibility was a core principle throughout the design process. Here's how I ensured a seamless experience for all users
                    <span class="paragraph-lists">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong><i>Strategic Negative Space</i></strong> <br>I <mark class="scroll-highlight"> utilized negative space throughout the app to minimize visual clutter </mark>. This improves readability, sharpens 
                                focus, and ultimately creates a more enjoyable user experience.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong><i>Clear Text Hierarchy</i></strong>  I implemented a <mark class="scroll-highlight">clear text hierarchy </mark>across the application. This allows users to easily discern between sections 
                                and information displayed on the screen, making navigation intuitive.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong><i>Accessible Icons</i></strong>  I integrated <mark class="scroll-highlight">easily recognizable icons </mark>throughout the app. This caters to users with diverse abilities, 
                                providing an additional layer of clarity and ease of use.

                <h5>Challenges</h5>
                <!-- <p>I embarked on this project assuming the process would be linear however at several points I had to test and 
                    improve on the initial research to ensure i was meeting the need of the user and the business. This expanded my view on the impact user experience in building a successful product.</p> -->
                <p><strong><mark class="scroll-highlight">Limited access to users.</mark></strong> Due to budget constaints, recruiting a large and diverse user base for 
                    testing proved challenging. This meant I had to be creative in my approach to gather valuable user insights.
                    <!-- <strong>The timeframe I set for myself was a bit optimistic. </strong>A full project would definitely require more time to design and test all the necessary screens for a robust user experience.  In the future, I'll need to factor in a more realistic time frame for these types of projects. -->
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong><mark class="scroll-highlight">Balancing visual design with usability.</mark></strong> Initially, I prioritized aesthetics, but user testing revealed confusion with some interactive elements. To address this, I embraced an iterative approach through multiple rounds of usability testing. This 
                    ensured my design remained visually engaging while effectively meeting user needs.
                </p>

                <h5>Impact</h5>
                <p>In this study, my objective was to <strong><mark class="scroll-highlight">address common issues faced by users and evaluate the impact of UX design on mood and decision-making process.</mark></strong> Through 
                    conducting this research and design, I gained a deeper understanding of how user experience can be influenced emotions and choices.
                </p>

                <h5>Lessons learnt</h5>
                <p>The key lesson for me is the<mark class="scroll-highlight"> importance of consistently involving users throughout the design process,</mark> ensuring the creation of a user-centered product while staying 
                    aligned with impactful trends in UX design.
