            <div class="prj-research-body">
                <h5>Understanding The Competition</h5>
                <p>This design approach started with a competitive analysis phase that provided valuable insights into prevailing industry trends and best practices 
                    employed by key players in the motorcycle marketplace.
                </p>
                
                <p>By reviewing established platforms like MotorHunt and CycleTrader I discovered they offer robust marketplaces for motorcycle enthusiasts that facilitate the realization of their 
                    dream rides. However, a discerning assessment underscored a notable oversight – a lack of emphasis on the luxury segment.
                </p>
                
                <p class="last-paragraph">With this in mind I further explored revered brands such as Ducati and Harley-Davidson in an attempt to understand what luxury looks like in the motorsports relm.
                    From this competitor analysis I deduced the following about the industry:
                    <span class="paragraph-lists">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Luxury is a concept best expressed through branding and the market positioning of a company.</li>
                            <li>Branding appeals to the users emotions.</li>
                            <li>The success of a marketing strategy relies on the platforms chosen to showcase the products </li>
                        </ul>
                    </span>
                </p>
                    
                <p>From here I decided to delve into the user's thoughts on the platforms they had encountered.  <strong>My research goal was gaining clarity on the initial target user, their preferences and their experiences with other platforms.</strong> </p>
                    <!-- which demonstrate their proficiency in creating engaging brand narratives through attractive imagery and 
                    flawless user interfaces. Their e-commerce features are shining examples of efficiency. Despite their success, a key gap emerged: the capacity to create a 
                    remarkable brand experience geared particularly to Southern Figure's target audience: <i>female motorcycle enthusiasts</i>. This would align with the proposed Southern Figure brand identity. -->
                <!-- </p> -->

                <br>
                <h5>What The Users Are Saying</h5>
                <p>Engaging and observing motorcycle-centered communities on digial platforms yeilded reliable information. However, this was a difficult task as these communities are not as many as I assumed they were.
                    Regardless, this cemented the idea of having female identifying persons as the main target user for the rest of the design process. 
                </p>
                <!-- <blockquote><u>Target Users</u> <br> > New female riders in the motorcycle community
                    <br>
                    > Female riders in the felt that they were not adequately represented by existing brands
                </blockquote> -->

                <blockquote><u>Target Users</u> 
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>New female riders in the motorcycle community.</li>
                        <li>Female riders in the felt that they were not adequately represented by existing brands.</li>

                </blockquote>

                <br>
                <h5>User Pain Points</h5>
                <p>The following user painpoints assertained the need to focus on women in the community as the target audience.
                    <span class="paragraph-lists">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>New female riders often find the motorcycle industry uninviting due to a lack of female representation in marketing and dealerships</strong>. 
                                This can make them feel unwelcome and unsure of where to start.</li>
                            <li>The absence of a central platform for female riders makes it <strong>difficult for them to find resources and support tailored specifically to address their unique needs</strong>  and interests. 
                                This can leave them feeling isolated and without the guidance of others who understand their perspective on motorcycling.</li>
                            <li>Luxury motorcycles often appear to cater primarily to a male audience,  emphasis on luxury within this segment <strong>can be intimidating, making it difficult for these riders to assess whether the motorcycles are even suitable for their skill level and practical needs.</strong>  </li>
                        </ul>
                    </span>
                </p>

                <br>
                <h5>How Might I Questions</h5>
                <p>Using data from the preliminary research I came up with how might we questions that would guide how I intepreted the research points and ideated a potential solution.
                    <span class="paragraph-lists">
                        <ul>
                            <li>How might I <strong>guide users on a seamless journey from brand discovery to loyal customers,</strong>  creating a positive brand experience at every touchpoint?</li>
                            <li>How might I <strong>create a unified and engaging platform</strong> that attracts and connects our target users, fostering a sense of community and belonging?</li>
                            <li>How might I <strong>integrate elements of luxury</strong>  into our solution in a way that feels genuine and <strong>addresses the core needs and aspirations of our target users?</strong> </li>
                        </ul>
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>With a clearer view on the research findings I created a clear problem statement to guide the rest of the design process.
                    <blockquote>
                     <u>Problem Statement</u> <br> New female riders feel excluded by a lack of female representation and intimidated by the focus on luxury 
                     motorcycles. The buying process is overwhelming, lacking beginner-friendly resources. This creates a barrier to entry.

                    When deciding on which platform would best serve the users needs I decided to check the current behaviours of most automobile purchasers and compared it with my design goals.
                    <strong>Initially creating a mobile platform seemed feasible following the assumption that users would want to easilly access the platform from anywhere.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>However, considering the stage at which the user would discover the brand I found is better to work with a website. It offers the same benefits one would have with the 
                    mobile application. Moreover, if the brand was to grow with a sizable customer base then implementing a mobile appliation would be advisable.
                    <blockquote>
                        <u>Design Decision</u> <br>Implementing the solution as a website due to its accessibility, 
                        content richness, community-building potential, and SEO benefits. 
                    </blockquote>
                </p>

                <p>Based on the research findings, I developed a user flow, centering on the core function of the shopping experience. 
                    This detailed flow outlines the precise steps a user would take to seamlessly browse, select, and ultimately purchase a motorcycle. 
                    <figure class="prj-illustration">

                    </figure>
                </p>

                <h5>Ideate, Ideate, Ideate</h5>
                <p>These low fidelity screens were the part of the first visions I had for the screens outlined in the site map. 
                    The main idea was relying on images to capture the users attention and reserving text for the important sections of the site.
                    <figure class="prj-illustration">
                        <img src="../assets/lofi-design.png" alt="">

                </p>

                <p> After gathering feedback from a test group of 5 users I decided to change the gallery section on the home page to show the categories of bikes offerend rather than displaying random bikes. This resulted in the hi high-fidelity prototype below
                    <figure class="prj-illustration">

                <h5>User Feedback</h5>
                <p>While this was a passion project I tested the final mockup With another smaller group using first click testing.

                            <li>Various payment methods were not integrated into the checkout process.

                <h5>Challenges</h5>
                <p>I embarked on this project assuming the process would be linear however at several points I had to test and improve on the initial research to ensure i was meeting the need of the user and the business. This expanded my view on the impact user experience in building a successful product.</p>
                <p><strong>Finding enough test users. </strong> It took longer than expected to complete the project because I spent a significant amount of time recruiting willing participants. This limited the pool of testers and potentially the range of feedback I could receive
                <!-- <br> -->
                    <!-- <strong>The timeframe I set for myself was a bit optimistic. </strong>A full project would definitely require more time to design and test all the necessary screens for a robust user experience.  In the future, I'll need to factor in a more realistic time frame for these types of projects. -->
