                        <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
                        <p>The initial stage of my design process involved conducting comprehensive research, primarily centered around competitive analysis. 
                            This research enabled me to gain a deep <strong>understanding of the industry landscape, spot significant trends, and identify best practices.</strong> 
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>Platforms like MotorHunt and CycleTrader offer a space for motorcycle enthusiasts to peruse and buy motorcycles but lack the luxury factor that Southern Figure
                            aims to embody. Conversely, Ducati and Harley-Davidson showcase remarkable design and user interfaces, effectively conveying their brand identities through engaging visuals 
                            and compelling content. While these websites excel in their e-commerce features, I saw they fall short in establishing a memorable and captivating brand image that 
                            connects with Southern Figure's target audience of female riders.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Secondary Research</h5>
                        <p>This involved exploring motorcycle-centered communities on platforms such as Reddit and online blog posts. I identified common themes, trends, and pain points that I
                            could address in the website design.  I learned that many <strong>women in the motorcycle community felt that they were not adequately represented by existing brands</strong>. 
                        </p>

                        <h5>Research Summary</h5>
                        <p>Southern Figure's unique proposition lies in seamlessly <strong>marrying functionality</strong> with a <strong>luxurious brand identity</strong> that deeply resonates with female riders. 
                            By prioritizing elegance, sophistication, and a sense of empowerment, Southern Figure aims to carve out a distinctive presence in the motorcycle industry, 
                            <strong>catering to the underserved niche of female motorcycle enthusiasts</strong>.

                        <h5>UI Design</h5>
                        <p>Guided by the site map and user flows I created a low-fidelity sketch and a high-fidelity wireframe to visualize the layout, content 
                            arrangement, and interactive elements of the website.
                        </p>

                        <p>The <strong>low-fidelity sketch</strong> served as a rapid ideation tool, enabling me to experiment with diverse layouts and explore design possibilities without being mired 
                            in intricate details. My focus was on capturing the overarching structure and fundamental components of each page, conveyed through simple shapes and annotations.
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="../assets/lofi-design.png" alt="">
                                <figcaption>Lo-Fi wireframe</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>Building upon the foundation laid by the low-fidelity sketch, I developed a <strong>high-fidelity wireframe</strong> which integrated more 
                            refined visual elements, encompassing typography, color palettes, and iconography. 
                        </p>
                        <div>

                            <!--add this is the final design of the highfi design. consider the lofi changes slightly different from this to create an impression of change afte uer research--></p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The prototyping stage played a pivotal role in bridging the divide between abstract ideas and tangible design elements.</p>

                <div class="testing-stage">
                    <div class="testing-stage-intro">
                        <div>05. User Testing</div>
                    </div>

                    

                    <div class="testing-stage-body">
                        <h5>User Feedback</h5> <!--add information highlighitn testing was done with 4 users and the recommended change was, addition po a search bar, 
                        an about us page and a link to customization form or addition of customization to request form-->

                        <ul>
                            <li>One concern was the <strong>absence of a search bar</strong>, leading to difficulties for users in quickly locating the specific motorcycle they were interested 
                                in. To rectify this, I <strong>introduced a prominently placed search bar on the homepage</strong> and throughout the website.</li>
                            <li>Another issue was the <strong>absence of an "about" page</strong>, limiting users' opportunities to delve into Southern Figure's brand history, values, and dedication to quality 
                                and customization. In response, I developed <strong>a comprehensive about page that showcased the company's narrative</strong>, its mission to empower female riders, and its commitment to 
                                delivering exceptional customer service.</li>
                            <li>Third issue was a <strong>desire for more customization options</strong> . To enhance the user experience, I integrated a <strong>customization section 
                                into the checkout flow</strong>, enabling users to communicate their specific preferences directly to the company. This customization feature not only personalized the purchasing 
                                experience but also underscored Southern Figure's dedication to meeting the unique requirements of its discerning clientele.</li>

                        <p>In embarking on this project, I encountered several challenges that ultimately contributed to my learning as a designer. <br><br> Firstly, as my first  
                            solo ux design endeavor, the magnitude of decisions to be made was at times overwhelming. However, I welcomed this challenge as it provided me with the valuable opportunity 
                            to learn how to prioritize and tackle the most critical issues effectively. <br><br> Secondly, the self-imposed time constraint of completing the project within a month turned out 
                            to be an understatement. More time was required, particularly for refining screen designs and comprehensive testing. <br><br> Lastly, the limited pool of users available for testing 
                            posed a significant challenge. <br><br> Looking ahead to future self-initiated projects, I intend to seek involvement in UX communities where I can access a broader range of testers 
                            and tap into the insights of potential users and UX experts.
