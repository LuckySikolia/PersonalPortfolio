                        <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
                        <p>The initial stage of my design process involved conducting comprehensive research, primarily centered around competitive analysis. 
                            This research enabled me to gain a deep <strong>understanding of the industry landscape, spot significant trends, and identify best practices.</strong> 
                            By closely examining the competitors, I can got insights regarding their strengths, weaknesses, and the demographics they cater 
                            to. This knowledge created the foundation for the Southern Figure website.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>Platforms like MotorHunt and CycleTrader offer a space for motorcycle enthusiasts to peruse and buy motorcycles but lack the luxury factor that Southern Figure
                            aims to embody. Conversely, Ducati and Harley-Davidson showcase remarkable design and user interfaces, effectively conveying their brand identities through engaging visuals 
                            and compelling content. While these websites excel in their e-commerce features, I saw they fall short in establishing a memorable and captivating brand image that 
                            connects with Southern Figure's target audience of female riders.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Secondary Research</h5>
                        <p>In addition to competitive analysis, I conducted secondary research to gain a deeper understanding of the target audience and their interests. 
                            This involved exploring motorcycle-centered communities on platforms such as Reddit and online blog posts. I identified common themes, trends, and pain points that I
                             could address in the website design.  I learned that many women in 
                            the motorcycle community felt that they were not adequately represented by existing brands. 
                        </p>

                        <h5>Research Summary</h5>
                        <p>Southern Figure's unique proposition lies in seamlessly marrying functionality with a luxurious brand identity that deeply resonates with female riders. 
                            By prioritizing elegance, sophistication, and a sense of empowerment, Southern Figure aims to carve out a distinctive presence in the motorcycle industry, 
                            catering to the underserved niche of female motorcycle enthusiasts.

                             This synthesis served as the foundation of a comprehensive roadmap that adhered to Southern Figure's brand ethos and resonated with its specific audience.

                        <!--add content that shows the ui design process the lowfi mockup from miro and the hifi from figma-->
                        <!--consider adding an interactive figma prototype-->
                        <p>Guided by the site map and user flows as my guiding principles, I progressed into the prototyping stage, where I translated conceptual concepts into tangible 
                            manifestations of the website design. This entailed the creation of both a low-fidelity sketch and a high-fidelity wireframe to visualize the layout, content 
                            arrangement, and interactive elements of the website.
                        </p>

                        <p>The low-fidelity sketch served as a rapid ideation tool, enabling me to experiment with diverse layouts and explore design possibilities without being mired 
                            in intricate details. My focus was on capturing the overarching structure and fundamental components of each page, conveyed through simple shapes and annotations.
                        </p>
                        <div>

                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>Building upon the foundation laid by the low-fidelity sketch, I honed the design further by developing a high-fidelity wireframe. This wireframe integrated more 
                            refined visual elements, encompassing typography, color palettes, and rudimentary iconography. Utilizing wireframing software, I created interactive prototypes 
                            that emulated the user's journey through the website.

                        <p>The prototyping stage played a pivotal role in bridging the divide between abstract ideas and tangible design elements. By fashioning visual representations of the website, 
                            I effectively communicate my design intentions to stakeholders and solicit feedback for further enhancement.</p>

                        <p>The final stage of the design process involved conducting user testing with a select group of representative users. This testing uncovered several usability issues that 
                            required attention. One major concern was the absence of a search bar, leading to difficulties for users in quickly locating the specific motorcycle they were interested 
                            in. To rectify this, I introduced a prominently placed search bar on the homepage and throughout the website.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another noteworthy issue was the absence of an "about" page, limiting users' opportunities to delve into Southern Figure's brand history, values, and dedication to quality 
                            and customization. In response, I developed a comprehensive about page that showcased the company's narrative, its mission to empower female riders, and its commitment to 
                            delivering exceptional customer service.
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, user testing revealed a desire for more customization options during the checkout process. To enhance the user experience, I integrated a customization section 
                            into the checkout flow, enabling users to communicate their specific preferences directly to the company. This customization feature not only personalized the purchasing 
                            experience but also underscored Southern Figure's dedication to meeting the unique requirements of its discerning clientele.

                        <p>In embarking on this project, I encountered several noteworthy challenges that ultimately contributed to my growth and learning as a designer. Firstly, as my first fully 
                            solo design endeavor, the magnitude of decisions to be made was at times overwhelming. However, I welcomed this challenge as it provided me with the valuable opportunity 
                            to learn how to prioritize and tackle the most critical issues effectively. Secondly, the self-imposed time constraint of completing the project within a month turned out 
                            to be an understatement. More time was required, particularly for refining screen designs and comprehensive testing. Lastly, the limited pool of users available for testing 
                            posed a significant challenge. Looking ahead to future self-initiated projects, I intend to seek involvement in UX communities where I can access a broader range of testers 
                            and tap into the insights of potential users and UX experts.
                        </p>
                        <p>Despite these challenges, I am delighted to have taken on this project. It allowed me to diversify my skillset, further build on the knowledge I have acquired, and reinforced 
                            my passion for design. I embrace these challenges as opportunities to enhance my abilities and look forward to tackling more projects with enthusiasm, eager to continue expanding 
                            my horizons as a designer.
